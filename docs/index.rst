Welcome to IMNN's documentation!
================================

The information maximising neural network (IMNN) is a fitting algorithm for neural networks that aims to maximise the Fisher information of a training set to produce the most informative set of summaries about the model parameters of a generative model of some target data. In particular, an IMNN can extract, asymptotically losslessly, information from complex distributed data in a :math:`d`-dimensional space and map it to some normally distributed summaries in a :math:`n_\rm{params}`-dimensional space, where :math:`n_\rm{params}` is the number of parameters in the generative model for the data.
