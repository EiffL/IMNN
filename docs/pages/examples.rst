Whilst there are many specific ways to use the IMNN depending on the size of the dataset and speed at which a simulation can be generated, the easiest way to interact with the IMNN is via :func:`~imnn.IMNN`

.. autofunction:: imnn.IMNN

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Here are a few examples of the IMNN being used:
